<h2>Chapter 1 — Our First Story</h2>
<p>
It was Sunday, March 16th, 2025, when your friend texted me about you.  
I wasn’t looking for love, but when I saw your pictures, I knew something was different.  

I was scared you might cheat or lie to me, but I chose to trust you.  

On Saturday, March 22nd, 2025, we met after school at an ice cream shop.  
When I saw you standing outside for the first time, I fell in love with your beauty.  

On March 25th, we met again at the ice cream shop.  
We were laughing and having fun, and in that moment, I kissed you.  
It was the best kiss ever.

<h2>Chapter 2 — When We Were at Our Lowest</h2>
<p>
It was Tuesday, April 1st, 2025, during Khmer New Year.  
You hurt your foot at school Songkran.  

Later that day, your dad found out about us and took your phone.  
I cried every day waiting for your texts.  

On April 4th, you texted me back.  
I was so happy.  

But then you had to go to KPC for a month.  
I overthought everything and made things worse.  
It was my fault.  

After one month, you came back.  
When we met again, we were happier than ever.

<h2>Chapter 3 — Our Distance</h2>
<p>
During our school vacation, I failed my class.  
I ignored you and played games all night, sleeping at 6 a.m.  

You were sad and cried because you thought I lost feelings.  
But I didn’t.  

I was lost and confused.  
Now I understand it was my fault.

<h2>Chapter 4 — Our Love Was Stronger</h2>
<p>
On the first day of school, I was happy just to see your face.  

We went to buy hotpot vegetables, cooked together, went to malls, and watched the sunset.  

You bought me a guitar and made me the happiest man alive.  

Even when your mom took your money and tried to stop us,  
we still love each other more than ever.
